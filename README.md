#smart_irrigation
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based Smart Irrigation System to predict irrigation needs based on environmental and soil parameters. It uses data preprocessing, feature scaling, and a Random Forest Classifier to make accurate predictions.
 Features
Data preprocessing and feature selection
Flexible scaling with StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, or RobustScaler

Model training using RandomForestClassifier

Evaluation using classification metrics

Easily extendable pipeline for hyperparameter tuning

Model Overview
Component	Description
Model	RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble
Scalers Used	StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, or RobustScaler
Evaluation	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Dataset Split	Train-Test Split (e.g., 80/20 ratio)

 How It Works
Load Dataset
Load environmental and soil features (temperature, humidity, pH, etc.).

Preprocess
Handle missing values, encode categorical features (if any), and split the dataset.

Scale Features
Apply a feature scaler (MinMaxScaler, or RobustScaler).

Train Model
Train a RandomForestClassifier on the scaled features.

Evaluate
Use classification report to evaluate the performance.
