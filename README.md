***Smart Irrigation System - Machine Learning Project***
This project presents a Smart Irrigation System that uses machine learning to predict whether irrigation is required, based on environmental and soil parameters. It aims to optimize water usage in agriculture using data-driven decision-making.

** Features**
Data preprocessing and feature selection

Flexible feature scaling: StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, or RobustScaler

Model training using RandomForestClassifier

Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Easily extendable ML pipeline for hyperparameter tuning

** Model Overview**
Component	Description
Model	RandomForestClassifier (from sklearn.ensemble)
Scalers	StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, or RobustScaler
Evaluation	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Split Ratio	Train-Test split (e.g., 80:20)

** How It Works**
1Ô∏è Load Dataset
Read data with environmental and soil features such as:

2 Temperature

3 Humidity

4 Soil pH

And other relevant sensor inputs

2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocess
Handle missing values

Encode categorical features (if any)

Train-test split

3Ô∏è‚É£ Scale Features
Use a scaler:

StandardScaler for Gaussian data

MinMaxScaler for normalization

RobustScaler for data with outliers

4Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Model
Fit a RandomForestClassifier on the scaled training dataset.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate Performance
Use classification metrics:

** Accuracy**

**Precision**

** Recall**

**F1-Score**

Use classification_report() from sklearn.metrics to summarize performance.

*** Future Scope***
üîç Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

üåê Integration with real-time IoT sensors

üì± Mobile/web dashboard for live monitoring

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment using Streamlit or Flask on cloud platforms

üí° Incorporate weather forecasts and crop-specific needs
